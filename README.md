# Replication of  "How is power shared in Africa" by Francois et al.

Part of the evaluation for the course "Numerical Methods" (Prof. Oswald, Sciences Po Paris, Spring 2021) was to use Julia to replicate a published paper written in Matlab. 

This repository provides codes and documentation for the project that I have worked on, namely the replication of the paper "How is power shared in Africa?" 
by Franois, Rainer, Trebbi (2015).
