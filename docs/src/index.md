# My Replication of the paper "How is power shared in Africa?" by Francois, Rainer and Trebbi (2015)

> This replication study was part of my evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021

The following is the documentation for the replication of the paper "How is power shared in Africa?" by Francois et al. (2015). I will replicate the author's Matlab code for the paper using Julia. 
In their paper, Francois et al. aim to answer the question whether African politics is concentrated in the hand of a small ruling elite.
